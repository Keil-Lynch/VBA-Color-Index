VBA Color Index

This VBA Excel project is to implement HEX color codes and color numbers allowed in the VBA.

Program Overview

With Microsoft Excel, you can customize a chart by changing its fills and lines, fonts,
graphics, and gridlines.  In the color palette for each workbook, you can adjust the 
intensity and shade of the colors if you use a color monitor. Any element formatted with 
the color you change, throughout the entire workbook, is changed when you change the color 
in the palette.  

You can copy the color palette from one workbook to another if you want to use the same 
custom color scheme throughout the set of workbooks.  You can, for example, create a custom 
color scheme to match a variety of colors within a set color scheme and copy this into your 
presentation workbooks.  When you create a new workbook, Microsoft Excel uses a default color 
palette that you can replace.
